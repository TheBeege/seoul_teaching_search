# Contributing

## Code of Conduct
Don't be a dick. There's a popular Code of Conduct around there around inclusivity and such. Assume that's copied and pasted here. I'm just feeling lazy right now. A PR including that CoC is welcome.

## Communication
This project is being coordinated via the [CodeSeoul Discord](https://discord.gg/HFknCs8) and [FreeCodeCamp Korea Discord](https://discord.gg/ESYY8jmCvs).

## Standards
* We're using WebComponents. If you want to use some kind of framework, you better present a damn good argument for it.
* We're basing this on the HTML5 Boilerplate. Read through [doc](doc) for details on how things should be done.
* Use SVGs for images.
* Everything should be reactive - that is, should support mobile, tablet, desktop, and even a damn television. Why? Because it will make us better engineers, and the schedule is loose.
* If you touch existing code, leave it better than you found it.
* We're using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/). Eventually, we'll generate release notes from commit messages, so get in the habit of this and try to keep things clean.

## Process for Contributions
1. Make sure you've read the above and `docs`.
2. Check [TODOS.md](TODOS.md) for stuff to do.
   * We may move to Github Issues / Github Projects in the future, but a local ToDo list feels better right now.
3. Fork.
4. Submit a PR.
5. Mention @TheBeege on Discord on either of the two servers listed in [Communication](#communication).
Be patient because Beege is busy and isn't a frontend engineer.
