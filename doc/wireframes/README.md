# Wireframes
Wireframes are made using [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/), an open-source wireframing tool. Suggestions for alternatives are welcome, but any suggestion must be free, work for all platforms including Linux or work for web, and ideally be open source.

Current wireframe only shows the home page, which is the MVP. Future features will be added later, so watch here for updates.
